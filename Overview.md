## Summary
This EDA project analyzes the sales data of an online store about gaming-related projects from **2019-2021** to understand the business performance, customer behavior, and the contribution of marketing channels.

The analysis shows year-on-year revenue growth, high seasonality in the 4th quarter, low customer return rate, key products' revenue concentration, and clear differentiation between marketing channels and platforms.

The insights obtained help to propose optimal strategies and the EDA results provide an important foundation for further analysis

## Introduction
The dataset in the report contains multiple variables, including:
- **Order information** (order dates, order IDs, prices, quantities)
- **Customer details** (customers IDs, purchase frequency, new vs. returning status)
- **Product attributes** (product names, categories, price tiers)
- **Regional data** (country codes and mapped regions)
- **Marketing channels** 
- **Purchase platforms** (website vs. mobile app)

The purpose of this EDA project is to clean, explore, and gain insights into business trends that help clarify important questions, such as: **how revenue trends change over time, how much do new/return customers contribute, which products are the main drivers, and which marketing channels/platform are most effective**. 

These insights could support data-driven decisions related to marketing, inventory planning, and product optimization.
